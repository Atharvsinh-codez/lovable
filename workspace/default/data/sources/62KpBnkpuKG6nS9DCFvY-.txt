Context

Today, Merchants reach out to support to get help in mainly two categories of issues:


Categories                               Example issue types


●  Order Management Issues - Issues related to the fulfillment and processing of customer orders. 
This group includes inquiries about order status, handling disputes, and managing items’ 
availability.
○  Order Status Inquiries
○  Menu Update - e.g. some item is out of stock
○  Cancel Order Request
○  Cancel Order dispute
○  Error Charge Dispute
○  Issues with Pickup
○  Item Unavailable


●  Account Management Issues - These reflect more administrative, complex issues that can impact 
the health of the business as a whole. It includes maintaining accurate account information, 
handling payments not received, and ensuring secure access to business portals.
○  Store Status
○  Deposit Discrepancy
○  Update Account Details
○  Update Bank Information
○  Issue with Portal Log in
○  Tablet ordering & status
○  Change of Ownership


While Order Management issues are by far more frequent and account for 72.5% of Mx MTO (vs 22.7% 
Account Management, 4.7% Other), Account Management issues are bigger contributors to a negative 
DWR (‘Did we Resolve?’). Today, Merchants report that they are unhappy with the resolutions we 
provide 27.9% of the time (72.1% DWR). Of these, 15.23 percentage points come from Account 
management issues, while only 10.6 p.p. come from Order Management issues (2 p.p. from Other). We 
attribute this imbalance to the nature of the impact that stems from an Account Management unsolved 
issue, given it can directly reflect on Merchant’s bottom line.

In this brief, we will focus on identifying key aspects that make handling Account Management 
issues hard for our Teammates.

Problem

Today, it is painful and time consuming for Teammates to diagnose Mx account management issues. 
This is bad because it leads to slow and often incomplete resolutions for our Merchants - 
ultimately eroding their trust with DoorDash.

Resolutions are painful and time consuming. Teammates are required to navigate through several 
different tools and follow multiple steps in order to understand what the gaps are in Merchant’s 
accounts and fix them. These steps are laid out in knowledge base articles, which makes the process 
tedious and prone to error.

Additionally, following these steps is extremely time consuming, which can reflect on:
●  Slowness in live cases: While complex account management issues largely get resolved by MXPs, 
their inbounds often begin as a phone case, which is handled by our T1 agents (81% of Account 
Management cases are Phone cases). These can be incredibly painful for the Merchant as they have to 
hold on the line during their busy operations, while T1 agents try to find a path for them.
● Slowness in async cases: Some Merchants opt to report their issues directly to their MXPs, via 
email (13% of Account Management cases). Here, a few minutes or seconds delay won’t impact the 
customer as much - however, these inefficiencies accumulate and consume more of our MXPs bandwidth, 
which prevents them from effectively supporting more cases across their 1k+ stores they manage.

Resolutions are often incomplete. Teammates will often only resolve the specific issue Merchants 
are reaching out about. However, these issues are often tied to other issues and only resolving 
what the Merchant is asking for doesn’t fully solve their problems. As a consequence, Merchants 
realize in the next few days/weeks that their issues are still not resolved, leading them to 
reinbound to support.

Supporting Evidence

1/ It is painful and slow for Teammates to diagnose Mx account issues

MXPs indicate that they spent at least 4+ min in diagnosis-only activities for these issue types 
(anecdotal, based on survey data). This time is not inclusive of executing any workflows and/or 
taking any actions to resolve the issue.

(1)  Diagnostic time determined through MXP surveys where midpoint of minute long buckets were used 
to determine an average time spent. Longest option given to MXPs was 5+ min and thus numbers 
reflected above are potentially understated as 10 min would be represented as 5.5 min.
(2) Source:  Diagnosis Time Data Capture

Example Scenario: Mx reports that they are not receiving orders. To diagnose the root cause, the Tx 
needs to check the following:

Tx Action
Tools (typically they check one by bucket)

2/ An incomplete (or incorrect) diagnosis leads to issues only partially resolved and reinbounds.

As the diagnosis process gets more complex, we see an increased chance of Teammates misdiagnosing 
and issuing incomplete resolutions. As a result, Merchants end up getting escalated or 
re-inbounding which can be observed with the high % of non-FCR (‘First Contact Resolution’) cases 
for most of the issue types in the table below (see column 2 in table below).

While some of the root causes for non-FCR are driven by the process that we define for Customers 
(e.g. Customer must get transferred to a specialty pod resulting in multiple touches), we continue 
to see significant non-FCR rates when these are taken out of the picture. For instance, when we 
look only at reinbounds for the same issue (Column 3), we see that  over a quarter of Deposit 
Discrepancies result in Merchants having to contact DD multiple times, and over 20% of tablet 
login/error messages, and ordering/returning issues require the same.

●  Issue: Mx flagged they received an alert that we couldn't deposit payments due to his banking 
information. Tx misdiagnosed that he was having trouble updating his bank account, and asked for a 
screenshot of the error message, along with verification steps.
●  Gap: Tx did not identify the Mx needed to update their information via Stripe to receive 
payments. They should have used the Payout
 Failure Dashboard to determine if Mx was part of KYC (see all steps here).
●  Outcome: Because of misdiagnosis, the Mx was told to fill out a form to verify on email and 
still nothing was done to solve their case. Mx then re-inbounded to us two days later and still 
didn’t have their issue solved.
●  Call duration: First call - 17:51 minutes; Second
 call - 9:39 minutes; (listen  here)
●  Issue: Mx logged in to the portal and clicked ‘activate your store’ but received an error 
message. T1 directed Mx to the bank account tab to validate if information has been verified. Put 
the Mx on hold for 4 mins to investigate. Determined the Mx was deactivated due to being at a 
residential address
●  Gap: Tx should have immediately checked MINT to see if the Mx was inactive, and why
●  Outcome: After 5+ calls in the period of 2 weeks going back and forth, the Mx was able to remove 
the fraud check given a residential address and get their store activated.
● Call duration:  25:43 minutes
●  Issue: MXP misinterpreted Mx as a bank account update vs removing a proactive fraud block on an 
update the Mx already applied, leading to the case incorrectly handled as a Bank Account Update.
●  Gap: MXP should have proceeded with proactive fraud block removal. We require only the photo ID 
(front/back).
●  Outcome: Merchant stated they had to be verified at least three times, and re-inbounded several 
times.
● Call Duration: 15 minutes


Proposed Solutions

In order to address the gap that Teammates face to correctly and efficiently diagnose Merchant’s 
issues, we propose to build TruthFinder - a diagnostic tool that quickly takes them on the path to 
resolution. This tool will be:


Principle
User Story
Example Requirements


Easily Accessible
Teammates leverage this tool as their default first step in their journey to work Merchant cases. 
Regardless of the channel where the chase is coming from (phone, email, etc), they are only a click 
away (or less) from accessing the diagnostics view.
Teammates see TruthFinder in their default Mx page in THQ. When dealing with SFDC, they have a 
direct link to this page.


Intuitive
Teammates easily understand the root cause of issues Merchant’s are facing by simply looking at 
TruthFinder. They are also able to proactively identify if there are additional issues (that Mx may 
not be explicitly calling out) that are impacting the overall health of Merchants’ accounts.
Through an intuitive UI, Teammates can glance through the Mx page and immediately understand the 
gaps with the account.
Once they spot the issues, they can also ‘double click’ on them in order to learn more and take 
action.


Accurate
TruthFinder is highly trusted by Teammates because it always leverages the source of truth. 
Teammates no longer have to double check status in different locations.
TruthFinder pulls information from the most reliable sources and is the source of truth for 
Teammates.


Scalable
Teammates continue to expand their usage of the tool, given they see increased coverage and 
applicability over time.
Through a scalable UI, we can continuously add more use cases to be covered by the tool.

We propose to prioritize the most painful issue types first, in order to get the tool off the 
ground while delivering impact and informing our next steps:
