Discover Phase:\'95 Document Upload: User provides research materials or product briefs.\'95 Insight Accelerator: AI uses NLP to extract key themes, needs, pain points, and generates an initial summary; the human reviews and refines the insights.\'95 Opportunity Identification: AI suggests actionable \'93How might we\'85\'94 questions and potential directions, which the user evaluates and prioritizes.\
Design Phase:\'95 Block Generation: AI creates diverse blocks (e.g., Personas, user journeys, problem statements) using the uploaded data and, if needed, secondary information.\'95 Design Canvas: Using a modular, block-based structure, users assemble and reorder blocks to form a coherent design narrative.\'95 Interaction Simulation Lab: AI models multi-step user journeys to forecast usability outcomes and identify potential pain points using probabilistic behavior models.\uc0\u8195 \u8195 \'96 Designers select prototypes, define key tasks, and compare simulation-driven metrics (e.g., task success rates, error frequencies).\
Refine Phase:\'95 Live Feedback Loop: As designs are iterated, AI analyzes real-world performance data, offers optimization suggestions, and continuously refines simulation models.\'95 Collaboration: Cross-functional teams align through dashboards displaying simulation results, usability predictions, and comparative analyses.\
